# Bug Hunter

When to use
- When an iteration is in a bug-hunting state or user reports failing behavior; for log aggregation and reproduction instructions.

Workflow
1. If needed, request bug reproduction instructions via LLM (`get_bug_reproduction_instructions`).
2. Check logs using a dedicated LLM check (`check_logs`) and stream breakdowns to UI.
3. Decide whether more logs are needed or a fix is identified; update iteration status accordingly.
4. Coordinate user testing and pair programming flows when required.

Dependencies
- `core.agents.mixins.ChatWithBreakdownMixin`, `core.llm.parser.JSONParser`, telemetry and UI helpers.

Output
- Updates `next_state.current_iteration` statuses, `next_state.action`, and may append `bug_hunting_cycles` with instructions.
