Phase 2 — Skill Extraction: COMPLETE

Date: 2026-02-04

Summary:
- Converted remaining agent implementations into SKILL.md drafts located at `skills/generated-agents/` (19 SKILLs present).
- Generated a centralized keyword ledger: `.github/skill_index/keyword_ledger.csv`.
- Regenerated skill index: `.github/skill_index/skills_index.csv`.
- Aggregated all `SKILL.md` into workspace root file `mcp` for debugging and review.

Files produced:
- .github/skill_index/keyword_ledger.csv
- .github/skill_index/skills_index.csv
- mcp

Next steps:
- Review the generated SKILL.md under `skills/generated-agents/` and refine descriptions/keywords where needed.
- Commit changes and open a PR with Phase 2 artifacts for review.
